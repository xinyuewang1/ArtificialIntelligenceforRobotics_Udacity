# -----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Modify the the search function so that it becomes
# an A* search algorithm as defined in the previous
# lectures.
#
# Your function should return the expanded grid
# which shows, for each element, the count when
# it was expanded or -1 if the element was never expanded.
#
# If there is no path from init to goal,
# the function should return the string 'fail'
